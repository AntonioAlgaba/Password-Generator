# Password-Generator
## Description
In this project I've created an algorithm to generate a random password.

The length of the password must be between 10 and 64 characters and th user need to choose at least one of the following options:
- Upper case.
- Lower case.
- Numbers.
- Special characters.

I have used diferents functions as well as diferents methods like Math.random, .push()., .join() as well as prompts and alerts.
